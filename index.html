We applied iterative design in our site after receiving the feedback for the website, going  through multiple designs until we reached the one we liked the most.

			  Empirical Measurement:  Here, the users interact with the prototypes while their reactions and performance are observed. Simulations are common in this phase, and he objective is to test which design works best the user.<br>
				Iterative Design: Finally, in this phase, after design and development all the system is tested trying to find common errors ad fix them through multiple iterations or cycles of design.

And this helps the site look more organized and prevents you from getting lost.  The site loads on an average time, which for a prototype is good considering all the content is one page.
